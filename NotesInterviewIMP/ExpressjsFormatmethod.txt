how this part will work

           
This part of the code utilizes Express.js's res.format() method to handle different types of responses based on the client's Accept header. Here's how it works:

res.format() takes an object where each key represents a specific content type that the client may accept, and the corresponding value is a function that defines how to handle the response for that content type.

When a request is received, Express.js inspects the Accept header of the request to determine the client's preferred content types.

Express.js then executes the appropriate response handler based on the client's preferences.

If the client's preferred content type matches one of the keys in the object passed to res.format(), the corresponding response handler function is executed.

If none of the client's preferred content types match, or if the client does not specify any acceptable content types, the default handler is executed.

In this specific code:

If the client prefers text/plain, the response will be plain text with the name formatted as "name: [firstName] [lastName]".
If the client prefers text/html, the response will be HTML formatted as an unordered list with one list item containing the name.
If the client prefers application/json, the response will be a JSON object with the name.
If the client does not specify any acceptable content types or if none of the specified content types match, a 406 Not Acceptable status code will be returned.
Each response handler function constructs the response body based on the firstName and lastName extracted from the request and sends the response using res.send() or res.json().
